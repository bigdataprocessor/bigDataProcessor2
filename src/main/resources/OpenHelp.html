<h2>Open Help</h2>


<h3>Open Bio-Formats...</h3>

<p>
  Opens all files supported by Bio-Formats. Depending on how the files are layout internally the interactive preview functionality of BDP2 may be slower than using below [ Open File Series ...] command, which have been optimised for reading data into BDP2. Please share your experiences with us!
</p>

<h3>Open File Series...</h3>

<p>
Big image data, due to its size, is often distributed across several files. BigDataProcessor2 provides several ways to open such file series. Most flexible is the "Open File Series..." command, where regular expressions (see below) are used to specify how the different files compose a 5D (x,y,z,c,t) image data set.

Currently we support specific flavours of TIFF and HDF5 file series.<br>

For TIFF we support single (x,y) plane TIFF and multi-plane TIFF files. In multi-plane TIFF files all planes must have the same size as they are loaded as one 3D volume with the TIFF planes corresponding to the z-position. Different channels and time points must be distributed across different files.<br>
For HDF5 we support file series where each file contains a single 3D dataset, which must be a 3D array with dimension order z,y,x. This array will be loaded as one 3D volume. Different channels and time points must be distributed across different files.<br>
For convenience, we also provide few commands to open commonly occurring file series, such that users do not have to enter the regular expressions:

<h3>Open EM TIFF Plane File Series...</h3>
<p>
Opens one folder with tiff files, each containing only a single plane, using the regular expression "(?&lt;Z&gt;.*)", which means that the whole filename is used to indicate the z-position of the plane in this file (using the natural sorting of files).
</p>
<h3>Open Leica DSL Plane File Series...</h3>
<p>
Opens one folder with tiff files, each containing only a single plane, using the regular expression ".*--t(?&lt;T&gt;\d+)--Z(?&lt;Z&gt;\d+)--C(?&lt;C>\d+).*", to open files with names such as "Position001_Target--t00--Z00--C00.tif".
</p>
<h3>Open Luxendo HDF5 File Series...</h3>
<p>
Opens a series of HDF5 files, each HDF5 file containing one 3D volume. The channels and timepoints are encoded in the file and/or sub-folder names, yielding regular expressions such as: ".*stack_6_(?&lt;C1&gt;channel_.*)/(?&lt;C2&gt;Cam_.*)_(?&lt;T&gt;\d+).h5".
</p>

<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Regular expressions are a powerful way to subset and group files.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html">Test regular expressions</a></p>
<br>

<h3>Few important expressions</h3>
<p>"(?&lt;Z&gt;)", "(?&lt;C&gt;)" and "(?&lt;T&gt;)" denote the z-slice, channel and timepoint groups, respectively.<br></p>
<p>".*" matches anything</p>
<p>"\d+" matches a sequence of numbers, e.g. 001</p>
<br>

<h3>Regular Expression Examples</h3>

<p>
Below examples are on purpose without file extensions.
The file extensions can be selected via a drop down in the "Open..." menu item and will
be added to the regular expression automatically.
</p>
<p>
Below examples work both with and without zero-padding, e.g. "T0000", "T0001" works, but also "T0", "T2", "T11" works (and will have the correct numeric-based ordering). Also, the numberings do not have to start with 0 but can also start with a higher number, e.g., 1.
