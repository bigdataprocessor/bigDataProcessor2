**BigDataProcessor** is an [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) plugin designed for inspection, manipulation and conversion of big data image formats flawlessly even on a basic laptop or a computer.
The plugin implements a [Lazy Loading design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) to seamlessly render Terabyte sized big data image data produced by light-sheet and electron microscopy, without bothering the RAM capacity. 
The plugin facilitates loading & re-saving of TIF, HDF5 and Imaris HDF5 formats meanwhile allowing the user to shear, crop or bin. *(check out the User Documentation section below to explore what more you can do!)*

The plugin also encloses **BigDataTracker**, an object tracker tool for the big data images and also allowing to view and save just the tracked regions.
The BigDataProcessor harnesses the power of the popular [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/BigDataViewer) to render and [ImgLib2](https://imagej.net/ImgLib2) library for image processing towards an efficient plugin software suitable for everyday use for all microscopy practitioners.

## History
The BigDataProcessor is a new revamped version of the popular [BigDataTools](https://github.com/tischi/fiji-plugin-bigDataTools2). The BigDataProcessor is developed almost from scratch using ImgLib2 framework while preserving crux the BigDataTools. 
The new plugin uses Big Data Viewer for flexible and efficient rendering however the backward compatibility with ImageJ1 viewer is a work in progress! Keep Posted!
